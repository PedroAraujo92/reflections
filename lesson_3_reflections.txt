When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  I'll use a remote repository when I want someone to colaborate with the project adding new features,
  or to work on a project with a team where each indivual has your own duty to achieve the same goal (the end of the project).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because sometimes I may have changes on my remote repository that I'm not ready to overwrite with updates.
