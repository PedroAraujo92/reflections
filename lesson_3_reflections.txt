When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  I'll use a remote repository when I want someone to colaborate with the project adding new features,
  or to work on a project with a team where each indivual has your own duty to achieve the same goal (the end of the project).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because sometimes I may have changes on my remote repository that I'm not ready to overwrite with updates.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	Forks are used when you want to change something on someone's project but you don't have his/her permission to do it, however, his/her project is posted on GitHub, so you would be able to change whatever you want without changing that person project.

	Clones are used to clone a respository. It can be used to clone a repository localy or to clone a repository from GitHub.

	Braches are used to add changes to a project without changing the master branch. It is used to try something out without breaking functional stuff.
